### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### What I learned

I learned how to setup a slideshow by using html and javascript, and navigate it using either the arrow buttons and the keyboard.


### Continued development

I'd like to update the slideshow. It doesn't look exactly like the mockup page on figma. I want to be able to display a part of both the previous and the next image of the slideshow.
